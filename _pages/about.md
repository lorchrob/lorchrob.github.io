I'm a third-year computer science PhD student at the University of Iowa, where I am a member of the [Computational Logic Center](https://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/site/). 
I work under the supervision of [Dr. Cesare Tinelli](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~tinelli/) and [Dr. Omar Chowdhury](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~omar/) 
(@ [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/)), and my research interests focus on [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), 
often with applications in [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security). 
You can find my CV [here](https://lorchrob.github.io/publications/cv.pdf) (last updated in June 2024).

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing guitar, reading, running, and weightlifting.
