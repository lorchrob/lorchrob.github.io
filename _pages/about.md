Hello! My name is Rob, and I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at the University of Iowa. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Cesare Tinelli](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~tinelli/), and my research interests focus on [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), often with applications in [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security). You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEwe7dUG0nUxcpa_mP1hDgnelcAN7Tr2/view?usp=sharing) (last updated in May 2022).

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing guitar, lifting weights, and playing video games.
