Hello! My name is Rob, and I'm a third-year computer science PhD student at the University of Iowa. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Cesare Tinelli](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~tinelli/) and [Dr. Omar Chowdhury](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~omar/) (@ [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/)), and my research interests focus on [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), often with applications in [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security). You can find my CV [here](https://lorchrob.github.io/publications/cv.pdf) (last updated in June 2024).

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing guitar, running, and rock climbing.
